As waggish boys in game themselves forswear, So the boy Love is perjured every where: For ere Demetrius look'd on <@290316208979574797>'s eyne, He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine; And when this hail some heat from <@290316208979574797> felt, So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt. I will go tell him of fair <@290316208979574797>'s flight: Then to the wood will he to-morrow night Pursue her; and for this intelligence If I have thanks, it is a dear expense: But herein mean I to enrich my pain, To have his sight thither and back again.",
